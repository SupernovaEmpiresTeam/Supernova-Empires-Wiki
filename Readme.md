# Supernova Empires Wiki

This are the source files for the Supernova Empires Wiki and all of its pages.

## Errors on the wiki

if you find any errors on the wiki you can report on the issues tab but follow the template i made for reporting that (click on Feature Request for errors in documentation, i changed that template to keep the bug report untouched).

## How to contribute

if you want to contribute follow this steps

- Fork the draft branch (fork this repository if you can't fork the branch and switch to the branch)
- Edit only the .md files inside the content folder (Unless you wanna fix something, witch you should explicitly write in the PR title)
- Make a pull request for the draft branch
