Blockcraftery is a mod that provides a very simple feature: Framed Blocks. Framed blocks can be placed in the world, then can be given another block's texture by right-clicking.

Framed blocks also come in a variety of shapes! Currently, the mod provides the following shapes:

- Framed Blocks. Standard full cubes.
- Framed Stairs.
- Framed Slabs.
- Framed Walls.
- Framed Slants.
- Framed Slant Corners.
- Framed Fences,
- Framed Doors,
- Framed Trap Doors,
- Framed Pressure Plates,

All Framed blocks come in reinforced variants, which are both explosion proof and fire proof. Any framed block can also be right-clicked with glowstone dust to turn it into a light source, even pressure plates!

Each can be textured to your heart's desire. There are many more frames coming soon, as well as new mechanics planned to make decorating even easier.
