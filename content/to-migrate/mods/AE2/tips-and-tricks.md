A load of random little recommendations

- Remove Optifine
- You can rotate and zoom into guidebook scenes that have the zoom and annotation hide/show buttons
- Keep your network treelike and avoid loops
- Full-block devices in groups of 8 or less unless you deeply understand how channels route through a network
- Pick a wood and stick with it for all your patterns. Yes, enabling substitutions in patterns sometimes works, but using the same wood type everywhere greatly reduces hassle.
- Arrange your patterns vertically in the ME Pattern Access Terminal/ distribute your patterns between your providers so that recipes can be performed in parallel.
- Add an energy cell so that your network can handle power spikes.
- You can use water in the Matter Condenser
- The best way to keep your network clean is to not put random mob loot like swords and armor in. Each unique combination of enchantment and durability is another type.
- An "item entering system" event must occur when returning the result of a processing pattern, like through an ME Import Bus, ME Interface, or ME Pattern Provider return slot, you can't just pipe the result into a chest with a ME Storage Bus on it.
- Don't forget that can rotate and zoom into guidebook scenes that have the zoom and annotation hide/show buttons
- The ME Pattern Provider will only push complete recipe batches and only through a single side. This is useful for making sure machines don't get partial batches, but sometimes you want the ingredients to go to multiple places. You can achieve this using an ME Interface, either as a "pipe" subnet or using its ability to hold multiple different item stacks, fluids, chemicals, etc. all at once, to use it as a sort of intermediate chest/tank.
- You can zoom and rotate guidebook scenes that have the zoom and annotation hide/show buttons
