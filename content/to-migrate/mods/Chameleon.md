Chameleon is a shared code library for Minecraft 1.8 and later.  Although it does not currently provide rendering hooks to restore the 1.7 render pipeline, it does provide a more comprehensive RenderBlocks replacement that is also suited for TESR rendering.

Chameleon is required for jaquadro's mods in Minecraft 1.8 and later.
