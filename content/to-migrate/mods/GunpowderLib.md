This mod is a support library for some of Jackyy's mods for 1.12.2 and above, it does nothing by itself as it's just a library mod, though I am planning to implement cosmetic perks for my Patreon and Ko-fi supporters through this mod in the future.

The mods that currently depends on this library mod are as follows:

- Exchangers
- Simple Sponge
- Dimensional Edibles
- Avaritia Tweaks
- Integration Foregoing
