This library mod includes an API for easy addition and integration with AE2's complex API and allows for automatic addition of infinite range-capable wireless terminals. It also has Baubles support built in. All packet handling for the Infinity Booster Cards is handled internally (including baubles syncing!).
All wireless terminals supporting this library will use the Infinity Booster Cards included for infinite range capabilities.
All wireless terminals supporting this library will show up on the AE2 Wireless Terminals creative tab.

### FAQ

Q: Why not just include this in p455w0rd's Library?

A: Because this mod has to hard depend on AE2 (it is required) to function. If I added this to pwlib, then all of my mods that use pwlib, would also have to hard depend on AE2.
