Baubles is a small addon mod and api that is intended to be used by other mods to add additional inventory slots to a character.

It adds 7 new slots: an amulet, belt, head, body, charm and two rings slots. The baubles inventory is accessed by pressing the 'b' hotkey. It is probably a good idea to remap your normal inventory hotkey to the baubles inventory if you are going to be accessing it a lot.

This mod adds very little content itself - it is intended to be an addon for other mods and the only reason I included an item at all was to serve as an example for other developers. The Miners Ring has no crafting recipe and is only attainable in creative mode.
