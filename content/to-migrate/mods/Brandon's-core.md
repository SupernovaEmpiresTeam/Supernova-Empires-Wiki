Brandon's Core is a library mod used by most of my mods. It is no longer a core mod as the name would suggest but it does still contain a lot of the core code used by my mods including but not limited to base classes for various tiles, blocks and items, A powerful modular gui system and a lot of other miscellaneous utilities.

## What it does

- Provides base ASM functionality for my mods.
- Contains common classes used by my mods.

## Details

ASM: (Modifies the the following classes using asm)
(Moved potion asm to Potion ID Helper to fix vanilla server compatibility)
(This mod will be used for any other asm that is required by my mods in the future)
