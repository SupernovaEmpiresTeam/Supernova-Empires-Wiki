This is a direct port of the Avaritia mod from 1.7.10.  Note that some items aren't possible with mod interactions as previously done in 1.7.10 and some mods no longer exist past that version. 
This port has been created with permission from the original mod developers.

All credit for this mod goes to the original developers!

Minetweaker Info (1.12x Only)

CraftTweaker commands are:

    mods.avaritia.ExtremeCrafting.addShapeless("name",output, ingredients);

    mods.avaritia.ExtremeCrafting.addShaped("name",output, ingredients);

    mods.avaritia.ExtremeCrafting.remove(output);

    mods.avaritia.Compressor.add(output, amount, input); //(amount is an int)

    mods.avaritia.Compressor.add(output, amount, input, false); //(if you want the recipe to use the scaling system)


They work similarly to the standard crafting methods in vanilla Minetweaker, so look there if you need examples.
